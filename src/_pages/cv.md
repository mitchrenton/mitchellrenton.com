			<h4>Head of User Experience</h4>
			<h5><strong>Adecco</strong> | <span class="cv__location">Zurich, Switzerland</span></h5>
			<h6 class="cv__date text--muted">October 2015 &dash; Present</h6>
			<p>I have built and developed an internal UX team, working on international projects in Europe, North America and Asia. My team successfully integrated UX design methodologies into the Agile development process. Working closely with product teams, balancing the needs of users with business needs is essential. Adecco's Recruiter platform for Europe and Asia was successfully redesigned, increasing platform speed, reducing complexity thus increasing productivity for thousands of front-line colleagues.</p>

			<h6 class="cv__date text--muted">April 2012 &dash; October 2014</h6>
			<p>Working in an agile development environment, I was responsible for delivering creative solutions to complex business requirements. My deliverables ranged from low-fidelity sketches to high-fidelity HTML prototypes. I created a mobile-first responsive front-end framework, which was deployed globally and is flexible enough to support multiple brands in 50+ markets. This resulted in a consistent experience for users and increased maintainability by reducing the design and development effort for new features.</p>
