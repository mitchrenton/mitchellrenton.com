		<p class="lead">I&rsquo;m a multi-disciplined UX professional based in Zurich, Switzerland. Originally from the millennium city, Wolverhampton, in the UK.</p>

		<p>I believe that good user experience is created when care is taken to leverage technology whilst understanding people and their needs. I see myself as a pragmatic creative.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m currently Head of User Experience at Adecco, the world&rsquo;s leading recruitment company. I am also a co-founder of Clever Biscuit, a small, creative collaboration, building simple, innovative products.</p>

		<p>Be True, Be Kind, Be Useful are my design principles, they allow me to focus on requirements and functionality at a human level.</p>

		<p>I started in the industry as a self-taught web designer, specialising in HTML &amp; CSS. Since then I've focused on interaction design, research, usability and performance. I enjoy keeping on top of new technology and I enjoy using it to solve real world problems.</p>

		<p>Outside of work, I enjoy the outdoors. I like a challenge and have competed in 2 triathlons, 1 marathon, a ski marathon and in 2013 I climbed Mount Elbrus, the highest mountain in Europe. Here are some photos from the trip.</p>
